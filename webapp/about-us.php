	<p>The “AMX” derived from the old industrial arsenal and industrial complex at Issy-les-Moulineaux and Puteaux. But the program was under supervision of the GIAT armament group (1974) or “Groupement des Industries de l’Armée de Terre“, the National Army Industries Group based at Roanne, in the Loire department.</p>
	<p>The group was responsible for most weapons in service in the French Army before constituting the core of the new NEXTER Defence industry group in 2006.</p>
	<p>The name “Leclerc” honored the memory of General Philippe Leclerc de Hautecloque that led Free French Forces in Africa and later in Italy, Southern/Eastern France and Southern Germany with the 2nd DB (Armoured Division) and helped to liberate Paris in August 1944.</p>
	<p>From the drawing boards and computer screens to the first batch delivered in 1990, the development took six years to mature. In 1986, the first six prototypes were delivered by GIAT industries. Tests did not however stopped in 1990 as the first production batch was delivered (four vehicles).</p>
	<p>Indeed, these vehicles were sent in other countries testing grounds for comparative trials.</p>
	<p>The next batch of 17 already included many improvements in the turret and hull armour, while the batch 3 integrated corrections in the engine and suspensions and was kept mostly for trials, training, and defining a new doctrine of use.</p>
	<p>The serie will evolve in the 1atter period (1998-2008) and now counts three series, not including the well-modified UAE version.</p>
	<p>The French army fields 406 Leclercs, 240 of which are in its four active tank regiments. There are also 20 recovery-vehicle variants in service.</p>
	<p>The three principal Western main battle tanks — the Abrams, the German Leopard 2 and the British Challenger 2 — share many design elements such as 120-millimeter guns, four-person crews and composite armor. While similar in its major performance parameters, the Leclerc exhibits a lot of French quirks.</p>
	<p>In place of a human loader, it features an auto-loader system with a rate of fire of 12 shells per minute. The auto-loader reduces the crew to just three — a commander, gunner and driver. The Leclerc has a .50-caliber machine gun in the coaxial position next to the main gun, rather than next to the commander’s hatch.</p>';
